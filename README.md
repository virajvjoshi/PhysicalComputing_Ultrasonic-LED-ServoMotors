# PhysicalComputing_Ultrasonic-LED-ServoMotors
Physical Computing project to connect ultrasonic sensors to LEDs and Servo motors

** Connecting Ultrasonic Motor to an LED light and Servo Motors**
I was commissioned to work at Chris Lefteri Design Ltd. with Matteo Bandi, on a project for a German Automotive Manufacturer. I worked in the capacities of Industrial Design and Physical Computing for this hands on project.

This application explores Arduino for:
01. Servo Motor Library
02. Controlling an Ultrasonic Sensor
03. Multiple void loop(); commands and conditionally switching between them
